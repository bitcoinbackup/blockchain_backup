DeNova Blockchain Backup
-------------------------

The biggest risk to holding your own Bitcoin Core wallet is losing
access to your money.
Any damage to your local blockchain can block your wallet for days.
Ordinary file backups don't help.
Blockchain Backup handles the complex coordination of concurrent
processes and metadata you need to restore access to your wallet fast.
